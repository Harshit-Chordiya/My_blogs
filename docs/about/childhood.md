# Chief Minister of Gujarat (2001–2014)

## Taking office
In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing, and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[110][112][113] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[52] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was "going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[114] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in[115] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.[116]

### 2002 Gujarat riots
Main article: 2002 Gujarat riots
On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[l][119] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[120][121] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.[10][120][122] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh (general strike) across the state.[123][124] Riots began during the bandh and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[120][123][124] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[120][125] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;[121] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000,[120][119][126] the vast majority of them Muslims.[119] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[127] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.[9][128]

Scholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[10][129] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[130] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.[9][131][132] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating.[123][124] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh despite such actions being illegal at the time.[10] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[133] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[134] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[9][122][135] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.[136][137][138] According to Martha Nussbaum, "There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law".[9]

Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, "What is happening is a chain of action and reaction".[9] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[139] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[130][140][141] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings.[140] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[140][142] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[143][144] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi.[145] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.[146][147][148]

###Later terms as Chief Minister

Following the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party—partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition—and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[149] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[150] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[151] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[152] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[153][154][155][156] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.[151] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[8][153] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[152] seats—a two-thirds majority—in the state assembly.[8][153] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza.[157] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.[158]

During Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[112][8][153] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).[159] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[159][160] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[161][162]

Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[163][164] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom,[165][166] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.[165] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[167] and the EU[168] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.[169][170]


Modi meeting with then-Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in 2004
During the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[171] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.[172] In 2007, Modi wrote Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a "spiritual experience" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[173][174] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.[175] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.[176] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.[177] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[178]

Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear skullcap gifted by Muslim leaders.[153] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[153] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.[153] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[153] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[151] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[179] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure.[180] After his election as Prime Minister of India, Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister.[181]
